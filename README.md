# workshop-react-typescript
This repo is used for workshop on React / Typescript workshops run on AGH.

## Prerequisities

### Linux
* Install `nvm` (https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* Run `nvm install 5.11`
* Run `nvm use 5.11`
* Use `nvm alias default 5.11` if you want to keep this Node version as default
across system reboots

### Windows
* Use instructions from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
but basically you'd need to perform similar set of commands as for Linux (`install`, `use`)

## How to perform initial build

* Go to project directory after clonning
* Run `npm run build`

## Regular builds

* Normally you run the application with following command: `npm start`
It results in hot-reload dev server being started on port 8080
